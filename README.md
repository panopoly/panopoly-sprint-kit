# Panopoly Sprint Kit

### Building the virtual machine

The VM build uses packer.io to turn ````kit.json```` into an OVA appliance. Please read [this guide](https://packer.io/intro/getting-started/setup.html) to see how to install Packer.

Simply run ````./create-box.sh```` to build the OVA appliance that can be imported into Virtual Box.
